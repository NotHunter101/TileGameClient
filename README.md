# TileGameClient

A clone of Terraria (sort of) made in Python. This repository mostly exists for archival purposes. Please note that this project was made in about a week so the code may be unorganized or unoptimized. I am also not very good at using Python so a lot of my code is probably not very "Pythonic" and my project structure is probably not very good.
